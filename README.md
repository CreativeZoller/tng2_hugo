## Usage

After cloning this repository, navigate into the `tng` folder, and feel free to browse in the project files.

### Installing

For OSX, try install using the `brew install hugo` command in the terminal.

In Linux you should use also `brew install hugo` for the same outcome.

> Please keep in mind, in order to use *Homebrew*, it must be installed first on your machine.

### Running Hugo in development mode

In order to run a local live/development server, you have to initialize Hugo in Development mode. you can do it by running the `hugo server -D` command in the terminal. It will watch for any modifications in your files and immediately reload the live server.

### Compile the site with hugo

If you finished with checking everything in your local server, it is time for a build, so you will have to run `hugo` without any other tags in order to do that. It will automatically create and populate the `/public/` folder which can be deployed anywhere!
